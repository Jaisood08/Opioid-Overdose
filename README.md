# Opioid-Overdose

A app to prevent any event of opioid overdose

This project proposes an innovative and out-of-the-ordinary healthcare system called
"Opioid overdose Prediction System" to foretell the risks on one's life put on by their
prevailing health predicaments. On top of that, we will work to provide an elaborate
data-driven real-time medical-alert wrist-band for the person at risk of overdose.
The aforesaid wrist-band will use blood pressure, Sp02, breathing rate sensors among
other necessary hardware, and work synergistically with our Machine Learning model
to instruct the people in concern, the precise technique, and accurate dosage of the
crucial opioid inhibitor - "Naloxone" to be administered
to the person in need through our dedicated app.
The mobile application in our consolidated system will also keep track of the personal
inventory and availability of Naloxone in nearby pharmacies for pre-emptive
emergency necessities and prompt action.


# Objectives

● To develop a hardware device that analyses various body parameters that
cause respiratory depression.
● To check if opioid overdose is the reason of respiratory depression.
● Build an opioid overdose assistance application that will
o Notify the nearest contact
o Tell the exact amount of naloxone to be given at a particular instance
o Provide details about where to purchase naloxone and the contact of
the nearest medical service available.
● To ensure the app is user friendly to ensure that the user faces no difficulty
using it.


# Project Outcomes 

● The application will come to aid as the incapacitated person will not be able to
treat himself in the underlying conditions neither be able to call for help.
● The application will display the correct amount of naloxone to be used
at the exact time so the person can be treated properly.
● It will provide other essential details such as where to purchase naloxone,
alerts about their stock of the drug and how to reach out to the nearest
available medical service.
● Instructions about the standard procedure to be followed while giving
naloxone to the patient
