# Opioid-Overdose

A app to prevent any event of opioid overdose

This project proposes an innovative and out-of-the-ordinary healthcare system called
"Opioid overdose Prediction System" to foretell the risks on one's life put on by their
prevailing health predicaments. On top of that, we will work to provide an elaborate
data-driven real-time medical-alert wrist-band for the person at risk of overdose.
The aforesaid wrist-band will use blood pressure, Sp02, breathing rate sensors among
other necessary hardware, and work synergistically with our Machine Learning model
to instruct the people in concern, the precise technique, and accurate dosage of the
crucial opioid inhibitor - "Naloxone" to be administered
to the person in need through our dedicated app.
The mobile application in our consolidated system will also keep track of the personal
inventory and availability of Naloxone in nearby pharmacies for pre-emptive
emergency necessities and prompt action.


# Objectives

● To develop a hardware device that analyses various body parameters that
cause respiratory depression.
● To check if opioid overdose is the reason of respiratory depression.
● Build an opioid overdose assistance application that will Notify the nearest contact
● Tell the exact amount of naloxone to be given at a particular instance
● Provide details about where to purchase naloxone and the contact of the nearest medical service available.
● To ensure the app is user friendly to ensure that the user faces no difficulty
using it.


# Project Outcomes 

● The application will come to aid as the incapacitated person will not be able to
treat himself in the underlying conditions neither be able to call for help.
● The application will display the correct amount of naloxone to be used
at the exact time so the person can be treated properly.
● It will provide other essential details such as where to purchase naloxone,
alerts about their stock of the drug and how to reach out to the nearest
available medical service.
● Instructions about the standard procedure to be followed while giving
naloxone to the patient  

# Product Perspective


1. First step on app is to login. User can sign in 
with mobile no or email but they have to give
mobile number and they also have to give
required information like –
● Current Name and Address
● GPS and Bluetooth service allowance
● Name and contacts of people to inform

2. On Second Step User have to answer some
questions that will help us in prediction of his
opioid overdose risk. Answer to be given
either Yes/No.
a. Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?
b. Heart failure?
c. Chronic kidney disease with clinically
signicant renal impairment?
d. Stroke (cerebrovascular accident, CVA) or
other cerebrovascular disease?

3. On third step user have to give details of
his/her ongoing prescription so we can
further predict the opioid risk and can analyse
the user in better way to give our best help.

4. On Step four app is ready to use the user have
to connect the watch with the app through
Bluetooth and their user can monitor his ECG
rate and SpO2 level and we will calculate
opioid risk at every time.
Here User is provided with other options
such as –
● Naloxone availability nearby.
● Opioid overdose prevention facts and articles.

5. If risk rate goes above a threshold value, we
will give an alert on mobile and if due to any
error this alarm is caused the user will be
given 30 seconds to stop it, else an alert is
send to all contacts given by user and further
assistant is given to them to save user’s life
from overdose.
